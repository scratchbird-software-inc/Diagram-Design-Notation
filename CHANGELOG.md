# Changelog

All notable changes to the Data Design Notation project are documented here.
Component-level history predating the monorepo import lives in
`notation/CHANGELOG.md` and `examples/use-cases/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [Unreleased]

- Standalone readiness: root `index.html` landing page with live in-browser
  render, `standard/plates/index.html` notation-plate browser, and
  `designer/prototype/standalone.html` single-file designer prototype
  (imported from the designer package, license header updated). Studio and
  gallery nav links retargeted to in-repo destinations; all entry pages
  verified over `file://` (headless Chromium: no console errors, all render).
- Repository created as the DDN open-source monorepo:
  - Imported DDN 0.5.0-draft.2 sources (notation runtime, CLI, Studio,
    specification, grammar, schemas, registry, examples) from the previous
    single-tree package.
  - Imported DDN Designer specification 0.1 (specification, contracts,
    prototype, research, design records, decisions) from its standalone
    package.
  - Relicensed MIT → GPL-2.0-or-later across imported sources.
  - Excluded generated corpora and prebuilt sites (field guide, enterprise
    review, rendered outputs, release evidence); available in the archived
    packages.
