# Notices and provenance

ddn (Diagram Design Notation) is an open-source project of ScratchBird Software Inc.
(https://www.scratchbird.ca), sponsored by the ScratchWeaver project
(https://scratchbird.ca/weaver). The free tools
are ddn-viewer and ddn-designer. ScratchWeaver is also the commercial diagramming
suite built on ddn; ScratchRobin (commercial database console/BI, https://github.com/scratchbird-software-inc/CDEadmin) owns backend
capabilities such as KEEL, which are not part of ddn, ddn-viewer, or ddn-designer.

DDN is an original proposed notation/language project. Original reference
code, SVG geometry, documentation, and site assets are distributed together
under `LICENSE` (GPL-2.0-or-later). The project was imported from draft
packages previously distributed under MIT by the same contributors.

Mermaid, Langium, ELK, Rough.js, Vega/Vega-Lite, React Flow, diagram-js,
JointJS, tldraw, Excalidraw, draw.io, yEd, Penpot, Unicode, W3C, and JSON
Schema are cited design/technical references only. Their names do not imply
endorsement, compatibility, or affiliation, and no runtime code from them is
vendored in this repository. No vendor logos or font files are distributed;
the reference JavaScript has no runtime dependencies.

`notation/runtime/ddn-sketch.js` is original DDN code. Rough.js documentation
was consulted as background for seeded sketch rendering; no Rough.js
implementation or dependency is included. The optional
`notation/adapters/vega-lite/` adapter is original code and is not part of
the runtime bundle.

Python rebuild utilities (optional) use locally installed `markdown-it-py`,
`jsonschema`, `lxml`, and `Pillow`; these are not bundled and their own
licenses apply to their distributions. The prebuilt website and JavaScript
reference commands do not require them. External specifications are cited,
not copied wholesale.

## Standards and notation attributions

This project renders diagram notations defined by external standards bodies.
Implementations are original work based on publicly described notation
conventions; no standards-document text, figures, or symbol tables are
reproduced. Support is profile-level coverage, not conformance or
certification.

## Bundled third-party icon artwork

Three shipped icon packs contain curated selections of MIT-licensed artwork,
each with its license text included in the pack manifest
(`standard/registry/icon-packs/`):

- **Tabler Icons** (`tabler-infra@1`, `ddn-pack-general@1`) — Copyright (c)
  2020-2026 Paweł Kuna, MIT License — https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons
- **Iconoir** (`iconoir-infra@1`) — Copyright (c) 2021 Luca Burgio,
  MIT License — https://github.com/iconoir-icons/iconoir

All are diagram-relevant subsets; the full sets are not vendored. Their
names do not imply endorsement or affiliation. Per-icon source URLs and
retrieval dates are recorded in
`standard/registry/icon-packs/ddn-pack-general.provenance.json`.
freesvg.org was evaluated as an additional source (site-wide CC0 per its
About page) and not used: its catalogue is filled clip-art, stylistically
incompatible with the DDN stroke grid.

## Bundled third-party presentation artwork (art packs)

The shipped art pack `presentation-devices@1`
(`standard/registry/art-packs/`, format `ddn-art-pack@1`,
specification chapter 50) contains presentation-idiom illustrations curated
item-by-item from **Wikimedia Commons**. Every item is CC0 or public domain
per its Commons license record at curation time; per-item title, author,
license, canonical source URL and retrieval date are recorded in the pack's
`provenance` records. unDraw was evaluated and not used: its license permits
use in products but not redistribution as an asset library. SVG Repo was
evaluated and not used: automated access is blocked and per-item license
verification could not be completed programmatically. Art packs are opt-in
downloads; they are never inlined into the runtime bundles.
